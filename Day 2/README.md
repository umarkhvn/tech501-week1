# Intro to Agile

### What is the Agile Methodology?

* A philosophy, a way of thinking
* Delivering immediate value rather than conforming to deadlines
* Incrementally respond to changes often, rather than a big overhaul every now and then
* Categorised by daily stand-ups, regular sprint planning, and retrospectives
* Not all organizations are actually Agile even if they claim to be
  * Cargo Culture

### Why is it relevant for DevOps Engineers?

* Helps to promote a culture of learning and improvement by incrementally improving a product by using core practices like daily-stand ups, sprints, and retrospectives.
* Emphasises the concept of continuous integration and releasing code frequently.
* Always having a minimum viable product to which you can build open.
*  Seamless collab between different teams.
*  Able to remain flexible.
