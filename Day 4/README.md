### Environment Variables

* Environment variables are dynamic values that affect how processes and applications run in the Git Bash terminal. They store information like file paths, configuration settings, or system details.
* Global variables: Available across all processes in the system.
* Local variables: Available only in the current session or script.
Case Sensitivity:
* In Git Bash, environment variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., PATH â‰  path).
